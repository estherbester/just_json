version 0.1 (10/26/2010)

This is a Django app that grabs JSON feeds from various services --
scripts.py will grab the JSON feed of a given service, parse it as best it can, and save each posted item as an Entry -- dumping all the JSON comprising that entry into a single field as a string.

TO INSTALL:
Just drop the folder into a Django project, add it to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS, and run "./manage.py syncdb"

TO SYNC:
In scripts.py, modify the ServiceFeed instantiation to whatever service you want to run.

As of right now, it can read Flickr, Twitter, and YouTube feeds.
