version 0.2 (11/19/2010)
Esther Nam

This is a Django app that grabs JSON and XML feeds from various services --
script.py will grab the feed of a given service, parse it as best it can, and save each posted item as an Entry -- dumping all the data comprising that entry into a single field as a string.  

DEPENDENCIES:
- Django 1.2+
- json module
- feedparser module


TO INSTALL:
Just drop the folder into a Django project, add it to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS, and run "./manage.py syncdb"

TO SYNC:
In script.py, modify the ServiceFeed instantiation to whatever service you want to run.

As of right now, it can read Flickr, Twitter, and YouTube feeds.
